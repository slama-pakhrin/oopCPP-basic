I have gained a thorough understanding of various systems or process 
through which a design/code might get simpler and efficient by weather using a 
member functions, or defining classes, or data privacy or encapsulation or such and such. 

I knew about object is a single entity that groups together related data and functnions
that operate on a data but realized that a class is similar to an expanded structure
and there are two kinds of class members: data members and member functions. 
I realized significance of data privacy and it promoting a good software
design by controlling access to internal data. Learned that data can be hidden
within a structure by using the private access specifier. Additionally, I understood
the idea of safe empty state which guaranteed the objects being in a usable state 
consistently.

This workshop gave me hard time in part 2 while debugging rather than coding the
actual program. I guess this was pretty straight workshop and did gave me lots 
of information regarding important concepts. Overall, it provided me a 
solid foundation on member functions which I personally think is one of the 
biggest takeaway from this week.
