This workshop provided me with a comprehensive understanding of dynamic memory allocation, function overloading, and the use of references in C++ programming. I have gained experience on their practical applications. 
During the workshop, I implemented several functions using function overloading, creating multiple functions with the same name but different parameters. This powerful feature allowed me for greater flexibility in designing functions to handle diverse scenarios. By employing function overloading, I was able to create functions like "read" with different parameter types or numbers, improving code modularity and enhancing readability. 
In addition to function overloading, I delved into the dynamic allocation of memory for arrays. I got to know that dynamic memory allocation does not require specifying the size of the array during coding, offering greater flexibility. However, I also learned about the importance of manual memory deallocation to prevent memory leaks. This taught me to be mindful of deallocating dynamically allocated memory to maintain the efficiency and stability of my programs. 
Furthermore, I discovered the advantages of using references in place of pointers. References provide a more convenient and intuitive way to pass parameters in functions. By acting as aliases for variables, references simplify code readability and reduce the risk of errors. This understanding will undoubtedly enhance my programming skills and enable me to write cleaner, more efficient code. 
Reflecting on this workshop, I am confident that the knowledge and skills I have gained deeper understanding of dynamic memory allocation, function overloading, and the use of references. These concepts allowed me to write more flexible, modular, and efficient code.
