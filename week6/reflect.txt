Workshop 6 part 2
***********************************************************************/


Completion of this workshop gave me understandings
in topics such as creation of copy constructor, copy 
assignment operators, prevention of it, overloading 
insertion/extraction operators, ifstream and ofstream
and many more. 

I got to know how objects are copied and how to create
a new object which is an independent copy of an existing
object making sure the dynamically allocated resources are
well managed. Declaring private and delete when needed or
to enforce a single ownership. Insertion(<<) and Extraction(>>)
operators when overloaded could be customized for the certain
actions to take place for user-defined classes. We could define
how objects are formatted. I used ifstream and ofstream to
perform simple I/O operations. It enabled me to interact with
external data sources. I applied string class for extracting
number of characters from input and further application of
other functions could lead to input manipulation resulting
in flexible user inputs.  

This workshop has had a significant impact on core concepts
like copy constructors, overloading operators, string class, 
etc which basically covered most of the important and basic
concepts that one should have to become a good c++ programmer.
Overall, I learned that these concepts which are building blocks
of C++ applications are very fun to learn and if done correctly,
easy too.
