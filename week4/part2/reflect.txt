After successfull completion of this workshop, the takeaways for me were 
concepts such as custom construction vs default constructor, destructor/constructors for
data loss prevention, accesing member variables and the usase of reference.

I learned to initialize member variables to default values, ensuring the object
is in  a valid state upon creation using defualt constructor which gets called
automatically when an object is created without any arguments.
Also, providing flexibility when constructing objects using custome constructors made
the code much convenient. Additionally, I have learned the significance of destructors 
in preventing memory leaks. Lastly, I learned the concept of using reference of current 
object which is denoted by `this` keyword, we coould access member variables and member 
functions of the object within its own scope.

To sum up, this workshop has very insighful concepts and it was pretty tough for both part 1
and part 2 to complete without any guidance. I pretty much struggled with the half assignment but 
the snippets you provided and explained helped me to get through it. Also, the concepts that I have
learned in this work are very crucial in upcoming works I suppose, and also for the real world scenarios.
