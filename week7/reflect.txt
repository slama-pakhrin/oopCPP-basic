Completion of this workshop gave me understandings in important 
topics such as inheritance, member function shadowing,
accessing shadowed member function, implementing custom input 
output operators with classes and many more. 

This workshop made us play with one of the important pillars
of C++ which is known as inheritance where it allows the
creation of derived classes that inherit properties and
behaviors from a base class. I learned about inheriting 
member variables and member functions of the base class.
Member function shadowing which is concept that enables
the derived class to override the behavior of the base 
class function while maintaining access to original function
through scoping. Usage of scope resolution operator (::) 
can be used to access the base class member function from 
within the derived class even when it is shadowed by a 
function with the same name in the derived class. I got 
familiar with the input and output stream operators where 
I defined custome behavior when objects of those classes 
were used with the standard input output streams. 

This workshop has had a significant impact on core concepts
like inheritance, member function shadowing, accessing those, 
etc which is also regarded important and basic concepts that one 
should have to develop a robust, flexible c++ system.
Overall, I learned that these concepts which are building blocks
of C++ applications are very fun to learn and if done correctly,
easy too.
