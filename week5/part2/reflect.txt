As every other workshops, this one gave a very significant concepts like
binary operators, unary operator, type conversion operator and many more. 
Simply, as the name says type converter was used to convert an object of 
one class type into another. This gave advantage  on the code flexibility,
and also compatibility between classes. I also got to know about the binary
operator and its types. Creating helper binary oeprator lead my classes to 
interact seamlessly. Overloaded operator considered as a member.

Like binary operators, unary operators could be overloaded by using
either non-static member functions or non-member functions. So, the actual 
merits that unary operator hold is that, it can wwork on a single object. 
Well, integration of fundamental types and user-defined classes with the help
of helper operator between a primitive type and a class was possible. This 
simplified the process.

To sum up everything that I have learned in this worshop, operators made it
easier to establish a relationship or say interact between different classes 
which are unique in nature. This operator overloading concepts have made this
workshop pretty easier and I hope evrything comes in hand in the real world because
this has taken a lot of time and dedication.
