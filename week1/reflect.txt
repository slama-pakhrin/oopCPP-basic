Creating a project and breaking them down into modules which consists of a header file and an implementation file is what part 1’s main objective was. Module’s implementation file is what carries the logic of the program. The file must have proper header file of a module that define classes and functions which is used in the implementation file. Linking is another key role in project development and I suffered in that part. I had the files compiled wrong all the time because of the linking error. The terminal explained the error, but I was unable to detangle it for a quiet period because I would do all the compiling commands correctly and still get the error. Later, I found that it was nothing but a basic mistake of not compiling all the files together. With this workshop, the little complicated part which I would say was pointers and arrays. Sometimes basic syntax errors made it time consuming. Coding the solution is easier compared to the debugging part. Well, the code this work made us do was sorting, loops and play along with pointers and strings. The task was to write a code for certain libraries that were used as pre-defined previously. The topics of namespace, pointers, dereferencing it, passing by reference and everything were informative.
