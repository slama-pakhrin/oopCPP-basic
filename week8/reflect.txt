First of all, this workshop has also been very insightful
and covered important concepts such as pure virtual functions,
 abstract base classes, virtual functions, etc. 

 Well, I got to know that abstract base class contains atleast 
 one pure virtual function and cannot be instantiated, whereas
 a cocrete class does not have any pure virtual functions and 
 also can be instantiated directly making it one of main 
 differences between abstract base class and a concrete class. 
I also learned how to create abstract base classes. I've also 
learned that pure virtual functions are such functions which 
do not have any implementation in the base class and are also 
marked with the virtual keyword followed by =0 at the end of 
their declaration. Somehow, polymorphism is also involved in 
process which also led me to strengthen my knowledge on such 
important concept. Also got to know that abstract base classes 
define the common interface and shared behavior among derived 
classes which promotes code reusability and a class hierarchy.

To sum up, this workhop covers one of the most important concepts
which will further direct to code c++ better and efficient.
These functionalites will improve the code functionality,
efficiency, reusability and many more. Overall, this workshop 
helped me enhance my knowledge further.
